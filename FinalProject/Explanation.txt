We have two clusters so that is represented on the X axis with counts on the Y axis
think of each cluster being a sample victim that is targeted most frequently
we can see in the Vict.Sex plot, that cluster 0 is the males cluster and cluster 1 is the females cluster
Looking at the rest of the diagrams, we can essentially determine the most commonly victimized male (0) and female (1)
using these clusters, we can pick the largest value in each plot to "build" an at-risk victim profile

Victim 1 (culster 0): Male, Hispanic, 30-40 years old, attacked between 4:00pm and 9:00pm
Victim 2 (cluster 1): Female, White, 20-30 years old, attackd between 6:00am and 12:00pm
We can say people with these characteristics are most likely to be attacked in LA

we can add location data to give a potential area where they may be attacked.
to do this, we will need to convert the lat and lon data to categorical data
or use k-prototypes that allows for both numerical and categorical data features
